As these pioneers successfully brought the connectionism and neural groupings into the world, other researchers started to work to complete the whole theory. One impor- tant completion is Frank Rosenblatt’s thoughts on how the information is stored and transferred in neural network.
In [41], he raised three questions regarding perceptrons: how perceptrons can help to 1)detect information, 2)store information and 3)recognize something with the infor- mation.
The ﬁrst question is quite clear. The answer to it belongs to some work within the sensing ﬁeld, thus this is irrelevant with this report. As for the following two ques- tions, inspired by the connestionism, Rosenblatt believes that simple logic and boolean algebra cannot explain the phenomenon very well and he preferred probability theory. He made several assumptions to the model accounting for randomness, plasticity and similarity and he proposed a model of perceptron with S-points (as input), A-units (as activation function in model neural networks) and R-cells (as output). The model is showed in Figure 2.
