This report is an introduction of deep learning models. Different from other deep learn- ing tutorial, this report aims to draw a very comprehensive and yet brief picture about how these deep learning models are developed. It is comprehensive because is covers a lot of initial ideas about network models, like basic Neural Network, Self Oraganiz- ing Map, Time Delay Neural Network. Yet it is brief because we cannot introduce everything about deep learning models due to the fast development of this ﬁeld.
In this report, we will ﬁrst trace back to the very beginning of how researchers start to model brain. With a belief of connectionism, a premier notion of neural networks is formed. Further, artiﬁcial neural networks are introduced with the successful design of perceptrons and backpropagation algorithm and start to play a dominating role in machine learning area.
