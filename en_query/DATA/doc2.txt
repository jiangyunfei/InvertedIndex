With the background of early stage work, the Section 3 is devoted to some famous discriminative deep learning models. From the necessity of depth of models, we ﬁrst move to stacked autoencoders and then introduce convolutional neural networks and some of its inﬁnitely many optimizing techniques. Most of these techniques could be generalized to other deep learning models.
Section 4 is devoted to generative models. Again, we travel through a long journey from the early stage work like self organizing map and Hopﬁeld network, to the middle age Boltzmann Machine and Restricted Boltzmann Machine, and to nowadays Deep Belief Nets, which is a natural extension of earlier work.
