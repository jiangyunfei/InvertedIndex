Then, Section 5 is a collection of neural network models for time series data, or generally sequential data. As a pioneer, Time Delay Neural Network is introduced ﬁrst, followed by Recurrent Neural Network and the famous model called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Then, an intuition of how these models could be beneﬁted from deep representation learning is introduced at the end of that section.
Last but not least, Section 6 is about some other interesting topics of deep learning and some topics that are yet to be fully explored when this report is prepared. Here, we will actually show some validation for the claim that deep learning is the best model so far. However, we will also see some ﬂaws of the deep learning, that may possibility hinder its further development.
